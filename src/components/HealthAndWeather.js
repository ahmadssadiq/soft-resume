                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Health and Weather Analyzer is a React and Node.js-based application designed to correlate real-time weather data with health conditions.
                            By integrating live weather APIs such as OpenWeatherMap and public health data sources, the application provides users with personalized health recommendations.
                            It is particularly useful for individuals with conditions like asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and allergies, offering real-time alerts and precautions based on environmental factors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Health and Weather Analyzer leverages <code className='code-block'>React</code> for a dynamic and interactive user interface, using hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage real-time updates.
                            The frontend integrates React Router for smooth navigation between components, while the styling is handled using <code className='code-block'>Tailwind CSS</code> for a clean and responsive design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the backend, the application is powered by <code className='code-block'>Node.js</code>, efficiently handling API requests and user authentication.
                            It employs <code className='code-block'>Axios</code> for fetching real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap and retrieving health-related insights from public APIs.
                            Additionally, <code className='code-block'>Google Authentication</code> ensures a secure and personalized experience by allowing users to save and access their health preferences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By correlating health data with weather patterns, the system provides users with proactive recommendations, ensuring they can make informed decisions based on environmental conditions.
                        </p>
